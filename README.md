notes mostly on backend engineering + code i'm playing with to practice these concepts

i'll be focusing on implementing them in either go, python, and JS

just cos I want to practice those 3 PLs more

topics i plan to cover:

- communication patterns
- protocols
- execution patterns
- load balancing
- databases
- caching
- async
- resiliency
- scaling
- queueing
- data delivery
